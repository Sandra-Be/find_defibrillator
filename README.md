# Introduction

I was inspired to create this project after I heard the incident on radio about Christian Eriksen a Danish professional footballer. This set me on the path living in Ireland where vast parts of the country have no immediate access to hospitals or life saving equipment and I wanted to come up with an idea to change that.

This website will be primarily used by the general public to find an AED unit in times of emergency, or to just know where the defibrillator unit is for future reference. Is also set up for community groups, sports centers and local businesses etc. to allow advertisement of the defibrillator for public use with contact information to be available to the public. This website has the capacity to save lifes in rural settings where an emergency teams will take too long to safe a life. The website features more insights about an AED product. 

It's a simple, easy, and understandable website for different age group people which will quicly allow the user to find location of life saving equipment.

## W3C Validation

To validate every page of the project, that there were no syntax errors, these two Validators were used, W3C Validator and W3C CSS Validator. Files of .pdf format is available under each Validator link:

* [W3C Validator](assets/project_files/validators/w3c.pdf "W3C Validator)
* [W3C CSS Validator](assets/project_files/validators/W3C_css.pdf "W3C CSS Validator)

## Bugs and Issues

**W3C Validator**

These warnings repeat throughout all html files.

* *Warning:* The *type* attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.

Warning was fixed by removing the *type* attribute.

* *Error:* An *img* element must have an *alt* attribute, except under certain conditions.

Error was fixed by adding the *alt* attribute.

* *Warning:* Section lacks heading. Consider using *h2* - *h6* elements to add identifying headings to all sections.

Section includes only one element.
