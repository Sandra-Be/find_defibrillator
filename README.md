## Acknowledgements 

* I was inspired to create this project after I heard the incident on radio about Christian Eriksen a Danish professional footballer. This set me on the path living in Ireland where vast parts of the country have no immediate access to hospitals or life saving equipment and I wanted to come up with an idea to change that.
* My mentor for helpful feedback.
* Student support at Code Institute Slack platform for their support.
